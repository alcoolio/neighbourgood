# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. NeighbourGood is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment where all people feel safe to participate, contribute, and thrive.

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and inclusive of diverse perspectives and experiences
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being patient and assuming good intent
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Being transparent about your limitations and asking for help when needed
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Acknowledging the contributions of others

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Discrimination based on race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, caste, age, religion, or other characteristics

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at **conduct@neighbourgood.community**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project leadership.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
